American TV Show 'Jeopardy!'
The goal of this analysis is to determine if there are any identifiable trends or patterns in the kind of questions that have been asked on the popular American TV Show, 'Jeopardy!'.

Original dataset has approximately 217,000 obervations (each corresponding to one show) that have featured on the show. I narrow down my focus to about 12,000 observations by using various qualifying conditions. 

I segregate each category into one of the three classes: High frequency, Medium frequency, low frequency depending on how often questions were asked from that category and observe any 
-  time trends in the average frequency count for each class
-  time trends in the average value(points) of question for each class
