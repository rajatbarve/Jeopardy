American TV Show 'Jeopardy!'
The goal of this analysis is to determine if there are any identifiable trends or patterns in the kind of questions that have been asked on the popular American TV Show, 'Jeopardy!'.

Original dataset has approximately 217,000 obervations (each corresponding to one show) that have featured on the show. I narrow down my focus to about 12,000 observations by using various qualifying conditions.
